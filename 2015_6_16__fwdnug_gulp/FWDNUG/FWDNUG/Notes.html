    <h1>Notes</h1>

    <p>These notes are for a meeting of the Fort Worth .NET User Group. If you weren't there for the meeting you might
    be able to find something useful there but this will certainly be lacking some of the context that the attendees
    would have, so YMMV.</p>

    <p>Our goal today is to learn how we can build a great development workflow with Gulp. To do this, we're
    going to need to hit a few points. First, we need to understand Node.js and NPM, because Gulp is built on
    these. Second, we need to understand how to use Gulp and its various plugins. Third, we'll see how we can use gulp
    to create custom, flexible web development workflows.</p>

    <h2>Node</h2>

    <p>Gulp is built on Node. So you should understand Node. When a lot of people think about Node,
    they think "Just another web stack." Wrong. Imagine is you mentioned the word ".NET" to someone and they said
    ".NET is just another web framework". As a .NET developer, you know that .NET is much greater than a web framework
    (like ASP.NET). Though Node is dissimilar than .NET an numerous ways, understand that Node.js is not just another
    web framework.</p>

    <p>This is how I like to think about Node. Someone took the V8 JavaScript engine of Chrome and decided to make
    an executable. It is true that the executable they made for node has excellent capabilities for creating a
    webserver, but what they really did is make an executable that gives you the ability to do file IO type work,
    networking, cryptography etc. In other words, a library for general stuff.</p>

    <p>Node is general-purpose but their philosophy is much different than the philosophy has been historically with
    .NET. The goal of .NET has been to provide a huge runtime and set of libraries on install. The goal of Node is
    the exact opposite. They have a basic set of libraries that come with node to handle things like processes, file i/o,
    net and other things. The basic install gives you a lot of functionality but nothing compared to a basic install of
    the .NET framework.</p>

    <p>When you install Node, you also get NPM, which is Node's package manager. Think of it like the Nuget of Node.
    Instead of trying to deliver a huge amount of stuff in the basic install, they give you NPM and the community
    builds everything outside of the core.</p>

    <p>To install gulp, you'll use npm. Some NPM packages are installed globally to give you global functions and whatnot
    that you can use. Some are installed locally only, because the project you are using just needs to reference it. In
    some cases the package should be installed both globally and locally, because you need the global commands that you
    get with a global install and the local files. Gulp is one of those. You'll install it like this on the command
    line.</p>

<pre>
npm install gulp -g
npm install gulp
</pre>

    <p>Next you'll need a gulpfile, which is what you use to configure gulp. The most basic one looks like this
    (and it doesn't actually do anything).</p>

<pre>
var gulp = require('gulp');
</pre>

    <p>We'll talk about this "require" business later on. An empty gulp file does nothing, so you need a gulp task.</p>

<pre>
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function() {
    console.log('you ran the default gulp task');
});
</pre>

    <p>If you are in the root of the application and type <code>gulp</code> (assuming you have followed the steps above)
    in the terminal, it will run that task. The string at the beginning is the name of the task. The thing that comes
    afterwards (in this case, a function) is what is executed. You can also create other tasks and execute them.</p>

<pre>
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function() {
    console.log('you ran the default gulp task');
});

gulp.task('other-task', function() {
    console.log('you ran the other task');
});
</pre>

    <p>You would execute the other task by typing <code>gulp other-task</code> in the terminal.</p>

    <p>Some tasks define their own functionality. Some tasks exist only to group other tasks together.</p>

<pre>
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function() {
    console.log('you ran the default gulp task');
});

gulp.task('other-task', function() {
    console.log('you ran the other task');
});

gulp.task('grouper', ['default', 'other-task']);
</pre>

    <h2>Style</h2>
    
    <p>Let's do something real. First, I need to style some things on our sample site. I can create a single css file 
    and that works, but it would be better if 
    we could split files up. So we can do that with gulp.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('css', function () {
    gulp.src(['assets/css/style.css', 'assets/css/calc.css'])
        .pipe(concat('all.css'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'))
});
</pre>

    <p>Gulp calls itself a <em>streaming</em> build system. You can see that in the above. First, the files are gathered
    then they are piped/streamed through another process for concatenation and then piped to the proper destination.
    You get the most out of gulp when you learn how to leverage this.</p>

    <h2>Minifying</h2>

    <p>Here we add minifying to the stream, so it gathers the files, concatenates them, then minifies them, then writes
    the output.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('css', function () {
    gulp.src(['assets/css/style.css', 'assets/css/calc.css'])
        .pipe(concat('all.css'))
        <b>.pipe(minifyCss())</b>
        .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'));
});
</pre>

    <h2>Sourcemaps</h2>

    <p>Let's put source maps into the mix!</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('css', function () {
    gulp.src(['assets/css/style.css', 'assets/css/calc.css'])
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
        .pipe(concat('all.css'))
        .pipe(minifyCss())
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write('maps'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'));
</pre>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>If the order doesn't matter, you don't have to specify every file and can use wildcards. For my plain js,
    this will work fine.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('js', function () {
    gulp.src('assets/js/**/*.js')
        .pipe(concat('all.js'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'));
});
</pre>

    <h2>Watching</h2>

    <p>Going back to the command line all the time gets tedious. You can setup a watcher to execute tasks when
    files change.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('watch-css', function () {
    gulp.watch('assets/css/**/*.css', ['css'])
});
</pre>

    <h2>Sass</h2>

    <p>But why do CSS? Use Sass instead!</p>
<pre>
gulp.task('sass', function () {
    gulp.src('assets/sass/main.scss')
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
    .pipe(sass({ style: 'compressed' }))
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write('maps'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'))
});
</pre>

<pre>
gulp.task('watch-sass', function () {
    gulp.watch('assets/sass/**/*.scss', ['sass'])
});
</pre>

    <p>Sometimes there are errors that need to be caught. Fortunately, packages often have steps to deal with this.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('sass', function () {
    gulp.src('assets/sass/main.scss')
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
    .pipe(sass({ style: 'compressed' })<b>.on('error', sass.logError)</b>)
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write('maps'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'))
});

</pre>

    <h2>Unit Tests</h2>

    <p>Of course you want unit tests. Here is how you would run unit tests using gulp and mocha.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('js-tests', function () {
    gulp.src('assets/mocha/**/*.js')
        .pipe(mocha({ reporter: 'nyan'}));
});
</pre>

    <p>It would be best if we could just watch the js files and whenever they change, run some tests. Easy.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('watch-js', function () {
    gulp.watch('assets/js/**/*.js', ['js', 'js-tests']);
});
</pre>

    <h2>commonJs and webpack</h2>

    <p>Back to that require function that we used above. Node uses what is called the commonjs method of loading
    js files. On the server with Node, this is built-in. But it isn't in the browsers. But you can use things
    like webpack to get you that functionality (and it does a great number of other things to).</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('webpack', function () {
    gulp.src('assets/webpack/**/webpack.js')
        .pipe(webpack({
            output: {
                filename: 'webpack.js'
            }
        }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'));
});
</pre>

    <h2>React</h2>

    <p>On the topic of file transformations, what about react? Here you go.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('react', function () {
    gulp.src('assets/react/to-do-app.js')
        .pipe(webpack({
            output: {
                filename: 'reactapp.js'
            },
            module: {
                loaders: [
                    { test: /\.js$/, loader: "jsx-loader?harmony" }
                ]
            }
        }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'));
});
</pre>

<pre>
gulp.task('watch-react', function () {
    gulp.watch('assets/react/**/*.js', ['react'])
});
</pre>

    <h2>Typescript</h2>

    <p>And some people like Typescript.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('ts', function () {
    gulp.src('assets/ts/calc.ts')
        .pipe(typescript({
            out: 'calc-ts.js'
        }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('content'))
});
</pre>

    <h2>Run a command line script</h2>

    <p>Sometimes what you need to call doesn't have a gulp plugin. You can always just call shell tasks using the
    gulp plugin <code>gulp-shell</code>.</p>

<pre>
gulp.task('cmd', shell.task(['dosomething.bat']));
</pre>

    <h2>Custom Gulp Streams</h2>

    <p>What if I want to write my own custom stream? It's actually not that hard. This one replaces the text "[$Yo$]"
    with the text "yo dawg".</p>

<pre>
var eventStream = require('event-stream');

function translate() {
    function transform(file, callback) {
        file.contents = new Buffer(file.contents.toString().replace('[$Yo$]', 'yo dawg'));
        callback(null, file);
    }
    return eventStream.map(transform);
}

gulp.task('css', function () {
    gulp.src(['assets/css/style.css', 'assets/css/calc.css'])
        <b>.pipe(translate())</b>
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
        .pipe(concat('all.css'))
        .pipe(minifyCss())
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write('maps'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('Content'));
});

</pre>

    <p>You can use this idea and do any transformations you want to any type of file along the way. Neato.</p>
