Upon this young boy had fallen the man's duty in a family of six,
including himself,--a now helpless father, a hard-working mother, and
three sisters. Since May, when the Senhor Almaida had a stroke of
paralysis, Jose had done the heavy work--for a young boy--of caring for
the oxen, the cow, the chickens and pig. Besides, he had done what he
could, with the help of Joanna, the seventeen-year-old sister, to carry
on the farm garden and the vineyard.

There was an elder brother, Antonio, now twenty-one years old. He had
left home, four years ago, to seek his fortune in America. It was this
elder brother whom Jose had been eagerly looking for during the last
four months.

Joanna had at once written to Antonio of the father's illness, but had
not suggested Antonio's return. "We must not send for Antonio," she and
her mother decided. Three times each year they had received money from
this elder brother; and the money would be even a greater help now that
the father could not work.

Jose had been given the letter to post on a village market-day. It
was then that the plan for his secret came to him. At the _correio_,
post-office, he spent all the money he had ever owned for a post-card
and stamp,--twenty _reas_, two cents, for the card and twenty _reas_
more, for a two-cent stamp. On one side of the card he copied in
printed letters, Antonio's American address; on the other side he wrote
the words: "Please come home. We need you. Jose."
