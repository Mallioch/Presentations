Covers the following topics in the React docs.

* [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

## Homework

* Create a clock component - Create a component that shows the current time and updates every second. They build this in the [State and Lifecycle docs page for React](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html). Bonus points - can you keep track of and display how many times the component re-renders?
